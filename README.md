# SensorRobot
A prototype of a simplistic auto-steer robot integrated with multiple sensors that can be sent through hollow machine parts or pipes to detect cracks and fissures using vibrational frequency analysis and anamoly detection.
In addition to the frequency and anamoly detection, the robot also detects any open flames, internal temperatures and moisture in the machine parts.
